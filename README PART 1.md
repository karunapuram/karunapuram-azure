# Technical Challenge: CI/CD Pipeline Setup and Container Security Implementation

## Overview

This repository demos cybersecurity, container security, orchestration, IaaS, and CI/CD pipeline management. The solution is divided into two parts: Container Security Implementation (docker and kubernetes) and CI/CD Pipeline Setup (part 2).

## Part 1: Container Security Implementation

### Scenario

I am deploying a microservices-based application using Docker and Kubernetes. Security is a top priority, so we need to ensure that the container environment is secure from potential threats.

### Tasks

#### 1. Docker Security Best Practices

1. **Use Official Images**: Always use images from trusted sources to minimize vulnerabilities.
2. **Keep Images Small**: Use minimal base images to reduce the attack surface.
3. **Run as Non-Root User**: Avoid running containers as root to limit potential damage from a compromised container.
4. **Regularly Update Images**: Keep Docker images up to date with the latest security patches.
5. **Use Multi-Stage Builds**: Separate build and runtime environments to keep the final image lean and secure.

##### Dockerfile Example

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Run as a non-root user
RUN useradd -m myuser
USER myuser

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

#### 2. Kubernetes Security Configuration

**Kubernetes Security Features**

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Restricts access to resources based on user roles.
2. Pod Security Policies (PSP): Defines a set of conditions that a pod must meet to be accepted into the system.
3. Network Policies: Controls communication between pods and services, enhancing network security.
4. Secrets Management: Ensures sensitive information is stored and accessed securely.
5. Audit Logs: Records activities to help detect and investigate security incidents.

**Kubernetes YAML Configuration with Advanced securityContext**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: secure-container
    image: nginx
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 1000
      runAsGroup: 3000
      fsGroup: 2000
      capabilities:
        drop:
        - ALL
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

#### 3. IaaS Security Measures

**Explanation**
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Security implications include managing virtual machines, storage, and networking components securely. Key security measures involve:
* Access Control: Implement strong access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access resources.
* Encryption: Use encryption to protect data at rest and in transit.
* Monitoring and Logging: Set up monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents.
